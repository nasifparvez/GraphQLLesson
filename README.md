# GraphQLLesson
Created a GraphQL API with an Entity of albums to teach my Advanced Java Frameworks Class in Sheridan College to teach the basics of GraphQL.
This lesson is made for those who have beginner or intermediate knowledge of Spring Boot. I have adapted the code in such a way to not deviate a lot from our 
normal method of creating REST APIs, so that students will have the ability code the project that I have posted with little to no trouble.
